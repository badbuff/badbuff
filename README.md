<!-- Fun Fact -->
Fun Fact ⚡
In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, a $125 million spacecraft, was lost in space due to a unit conversion error. Engineers failed to convert English units to metric units, causing the spacecraft to approach Mars at too low an altitude, ultimately leading to its disintegration in the Martian atmosphere. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the critical importance of meticulous testing and quality assurance in software development, even in the most high-stakes environments! 🚀🌌
